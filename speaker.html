                                            Mor Vered is a Lecturer at Monash University in the Faculty of IT. 
                                            Her research interest is in the field of Human-Centered XAI and in 
                                            the interaction between humans and intelligent agents, where she
                                            works to incorporate lessons and inspirations from cognitive science, 
                                            neuroscience and biology. She is a firm believer that only by focusing 
                                            on interdisciplinary studies can we achieve results that can strongly 
                                            impact human life. Her research interests further include social human
                                            agent interaction, cognitive modeling and psychology.</p>

                                            from University of Edinburgh. He started his work in industrial research in Xerox Research Centre where he had
                                            contributed to the use of Machine Learning in intelligent transportation systems including some of the transportation
                                            systems in India. The research included use of machine learning to aid robust and dynamic scheduling of public transport.
                                            He currently leads the research team on Machine Learning in AI Labs within American Express and is currently actively
                                            researching different aspects of Ethical AI and Differential Privacy.</p>
